Network Scanner

Overview

This Network Scanner is a Python-based tool that identifies active devices on a local network using ARP scanning. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input a target IP range, start scans, view results, and save them for later analysis.

Features

User-Friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter for an interactive experience.

ARP Scanning: Identifies active devices on the network.

MAC Address Resolution: Retrieves MAC addresses of detected devices.

OS Detection: Attempts to identify operating systems.

Results Display: Shows scan results in a structured format.

Save & View Results: Export results as CSV for future reference.

Error Handling: Ensures valid input and provides meaningful feedback.

Requirements

Hardware

Processor: Intel Core i3 or higher (or equivalent AMD)

RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)

Storage: At least 500MB of free space

Network Adapter: Capable of sending ARP packets

Software

OS: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), or macOS

Python: Version 3.8 or later

Dependencies:

scapy (for network scanning)

tkinter (for GUI, included in Python)

ipaddress (for IP validation)

csv & datetime (for logging, included in Python)

prettytable (for structured output)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mbikal/Network-scanner-with-tkinter-gui.git
cd network-scanner

Install dependencies:

pip install scapy prettytable ipaddress

Run the scanner:

python main.py

Usage

Open the application.

Enter the target IP or subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.1/24).

Click the "Scan" button to start.

View the scanned results in the table.

Save results as a CSV file if needed.

Future Improvements

Real-time Monitoring: Continuous network scanning with live updates.

Multithreading: Speed up scanning by running multiple queries simultaneously.

Expanded OS Detection: Improve detection accuracy using more fingerprinting techniques.

Export to Multiple Formats: Support saving results in JSON and XML.

Additional Scanning Methods: Implement other network discovery techniques beyond ARP.
